# AmphiFoundation
Foundation model for MFB liposome

## Folder structure
In this repo, it has 3 folders: 'code', 'data', and 'results'.

### folder 'code'
- In this folder, it has 2 subfolders: 'src', 'notebooks', which store the source code for the foundation model related analysis, microscopy analysis, and working notebooks.

### folder 'data'
In this folder, it stores the data files for foundation model related analysis and microscopy images:
-  input data surfactant, binary aqueous mixture, and amphiphile mixture
-  Original microscopy image and vesicles detection results. These data files can be seen in [[Zenodo link]([https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17401465])]

Note, in this repository, we have used the term 'similar' and 'dissimilar' as a shorthand for hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon amphiphiles. However, in the manuscript, we have opted to use the formal name, hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon, to elucidate its chemical structures.

### folder 'results'
In this folder, it contains the results produced by working notebooks.
