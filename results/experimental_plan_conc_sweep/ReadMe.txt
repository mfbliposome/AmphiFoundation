It contains 3 subfolder: 'concentrations', 'dispense_volume', and 'integrate', 
which include files for concentration of amphiphiles, dispense volumes and combined dispense volume file for all samples.
Here's naming system for these files (e.g. sample144_dis_1_dispense_volumes.csv, sample240_fmvsgp_0_dispense_volumes.csv, sample288_dis_1_dispense_volumes.csv):  
'sample144', 'sample240', 'sample288' stands for the sample composition from AL paper;
'ori', 'smi', 'dis' stands for original amphiphiles, replaced with similar amphiphile, replaced with dissimilar amphiphile;
'fmvsgp' are samples that comparing fm and gp models.
Index '1', '2',...etc, are samples that sweeped concentrations.
